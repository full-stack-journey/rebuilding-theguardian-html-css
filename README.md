# The First Step

The first step of my full stack journey is to learn the ins and outs of HTML and CSS.

## The Goal

Recreate the landing page (and maybe the other pages) of https://theguardian.engineering/ using HTML and CSS only.

## Checkpoints

- [x]  ~~Static page~~
- [x] ~~Responsive page~~
- [ ] Add other pages and link them up

#### Progress can be seen at https://theguardian-remake-static.netlify.app/
