# The First Step

The first step of my full stack journey is to learn the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## The Goal

Recreate the landing page (and maybe the other pages) of https://theguardian.engineering/ using HTML and CSS only.

## Checkpoints

- [x]  ~~Static page (HTML, CSS)~~
- [x] ~~Responsive page (HTML, CSS)~~
- [ ] Add other pages and link up with JavaScript

#### Progress can be seen at https://theguardian-remake-static.netlify.app/
